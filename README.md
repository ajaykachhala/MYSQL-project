# MYSQL-project

Project Overview:
üåê Database:

The project focused on leveraging the World Database in MySQL to explore relational databases, different types of relationships, normalization, and executing diverse queries for insightful data retrieval.
Types of Relationships in Relational Databases:
1. One-to-One Relationship:

    Example: The relationship between a "Country" and its "Capital" in the "City" table. Each country has only one capital.

2. One-to-Many Relationship:

    Example: The relationship between "Country" and "City" tables. One country can have multiple cities.

3. Many-to-Many Relationship:

    Example: The relationship between "Country" and "Language" tables. Multiple countries can share the same language, and a country can have multiple languages.

Normalization in Database Development:
üîÑ Definition:

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.
üîë Importance:

    Data Integrity: Reduces the risk of data anomalies and ensures consistency.
    Efficiency: Optimizes storage and enhances query performance.
    Flexibility: Easier to modify and extend the database structure.


Foreign Keys:

    City Table: CountryCode (References Country table)
    CountryLanguage Table: CountryCode (References Country table)

# Here are some example queries:
-The population and life expectancy in Argentina are 37032000 and 75.1 respectively.

Conclusion:

The MySQL project using the World Database successfully explored different types of relationships, normalization, and executed diverse queries for insightful data retrieval. The EER diagram provided clarity on primary and foreign keys, essential for maintaining a well-structured and efficient relational database.
